When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you would like others to contribute to your project, add feature and fix bugs with you.
Basically, when you want others to be able to access your project too.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because, sometimes you might not want to pull something, either because it is not ready to be pulled or because it is a branch
you don't need and would just take up space for nothing.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

When doing a fork you are copying something from another person's gitHub profile to yours. So from online to online = fork,
When cloning you are copying something either online or in your computer to your computer.
Branches here refers to creating a branch in your actual repository.
